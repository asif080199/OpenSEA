write documentation for Power\&. Power extracted should be based on each equation entered\&. We need a summary for each force\&. Possibly also a summary for total force\&. Remember that only a force, reactive in nature, can extract power\&.

State how the RAO is calculated\&. For every output, ofreq calculates both the true response value, and the RAO for that value\&. They are listed sequentially\&. First the response, then the RAO\&.

Sometimes it can be very confusing which part of the input wave properties are used to normalize the output\&. This section should explicitely state how the RAO was calculated\&.

Sometimes it can be very confusing what the units of an RAO are\&. So this should clarify\&.
