.SH "Calculation Method"

.PP
This calculation should include the $ sin(\theta)$ terms\&. For example:
.PP
\[ \ddot x_2 = ... + g sin \left ( \theta \right ) \].PP

\[ |I_2|=\left| \int_{0}^T \psi(t) \left\{ u(a,t)- \int_{\gamma(t)}^a \frac{d\theta}{k(\theta,t)} \int_{a}^\theta c(\xi)u_t(\xi,t)\,d\xi \right\} dt \right| \].PP
.SH "RAO Calculation"
.PP
.PP
State how the RAO is calculated\&. For every output, ofreq calculates both the true response value, and the RAO for that value\&. They are listed sequentially\&. First the response, then the RAO\&.

.SS "RAO Normalization\&."
.PP
Sometimes it can be very confusing which part of the input wave properties are used to normalize the output\&. This section should explicitely state how the RAO was calculated\&.
.PP
.SS "RAO Units"
.PP
Sometimes it can be very confusing what the units of an RAO are\&. So this should clarify\&.
