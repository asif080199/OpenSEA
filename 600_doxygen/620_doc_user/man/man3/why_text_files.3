.SH "Why Text File Interface?"

A major criticism of ofreq is that is does not natively use a GUI interface\&. The subject of text file interaces was given careful consideration\&. There are several reasons why text file interfaces were used\&. THe first and primary reason is:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Provide a neutral interface between people with software engineering specialization and people with marine engineering specialization\&.
.PP

Many sections of ofreq require detailed knowledge of marine engineering and seakeeping mathematics\&. This is knowledge that most software engineers do not normally posses\&. On the other hand, most marine engineers are not competent enough with programming to handle coding a GUI interface\&. But the marine engineer can normally handle a text file interface\&. The text file interfaces provide a neutral format that is easily handled by people in both skill sets: marine engineering and software engineering\&.
.PP
The intent is always to provide a GUI for ofreq\&. However, this GUI will stand on its own and support the entire OpenSEA software suite\&.
.PP
There are several other reasons for the text file interface\&.

.IP "1." 4
Some advanced users (whole companies) may want to incorporate ofreq into their own calculation software\&. In that case, the user will create their own interace\&. A text based interface allows users to develop third-party GUI's without re-coding and recompiling ofreq\&.
.IP "2." 4
Many times users need to extract individual pieces of information from the outputs\&. The text file interface makes it very easy to extract information and paste into spreadsheet applications\&.
.IP "3." 4
Users may log into remote computers to use this software\&. Advanced engineering software, such as OpenSEA, is often installed on power machines devoted exclusively for intense computations\&. Sometimes these remote connections lack a GUI interface\&. In that case, oFreq can still be used through console only\&.
.IP "4." 4
Eventually, OpenSEA will include a batch program that creates batch runs of these programs and edits the text files for both input and output\&. A text interface leaves open the most options for that batch program\&.

For all of these reasons, the text interface is the way I decided to go\&. It only makes sense because I intend to eventualy supplement this with a GUI interface\&.
