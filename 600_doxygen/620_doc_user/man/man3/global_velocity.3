State how the RAO is calculated\&. For every output, ofreq calculates both the true response value, and the RAO for that value\&. They are listed sequentially\&. First the response, then the RAO\&.

Sometimes it can be very confusing which part of the input wave properties are used to normalize the output\&. This section should explicitely state how the RAO was calculated\&.

.SS "RAO Units"

Sometimes it can be very confusing what the units of an RAO are\&. So this should clarify\&.
