Introduction</h1>
<p>This section covers the basic procedures for how to generate documentation for the OpenSEA project. This includes the types of documentation, which applications to use for documentation generation, and how to generate the documentation.</p>
<p>Accurate documentation is critical for this project. Even more critical than having code completely bug free. The users must trust the program, and to do that, they will want to thoroughly understand how the program operates. To that end, every application in OpenSEA has three documentation manuals associated with it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Developer Manual</li>
<li>Theory Manual</li>
<li>User Manual</li>
</ol>
<p>Each manual has a specific purpose. You can read more in the following sections. Beyond these three manuals, there is also some documentation that is common to all three manuals. This is documented separately and then referenced for inclusion in all three manuals.</p>
<p>The OpenSEA project uses two completely different applications for generating documentation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Doxygen<ul>
<li>Used to document source code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Office / Libre Office<ul>
<li>Used to document user manual and theory manual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two systems then get combined together with the Qt help project system to generate a single coherent set of documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="documentation_twosyst"></a>
Why Two Systems</h2>
<p>Why create two documentation systems? Doesn't it cause extra confusion? Short answer: Yes, but the extra effort is worth the reliability and efficiency of features. This is a case of once again appealing to the primary developer roles on the OpenSEA project: software engineers, and marine engineers.</p>
<p>The code is best documented with Doxygen. This allows the authors to write code documention directly in the source files when they write the code. That ensures the documentation is directly avaiable, maintains consistency with the code, and saves on many hours of writing and formating separate documentation.</p>
<p>But there is another side of documentation: the user. The common user for OpenSEA has an advanced technical background and was trained to suspect all programs are wrong until thoroughly validated and documented. Thus is it is important to have extensive documentation on theory and use of the program. This builds user confidence.</p>
<p>The development environment of Open Office / Libre Office is ideally suited to the user and theory manauls. These manuals need to read more like a scientific paper. Simple things like spelling and typos can quickly undermine user confidence. Open Office / Libre Office includes all the authoring tools necessary to automatically check for these items. It also includes automatic referencing and a bibliography. All necessary for the scientific background of this program.</p>
<p>Finally, it is still important to present a consistent appearance for easier user interface. The Qt help system can combine the two authoring systems together into a single, final set of user documentation with all the expected features of searches, an index, and table of contents.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="documentation_manuals"></a>
Documentation Manuals</h1>
<p>There are three main documentation manuals. Each with their own style and purpose. And there is also commmon documentation that gets included in all three manuals.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="documentation_developer"></a>
Developer Manual</h2>
<p>The developer manual contains all the details of the software coding itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generated using doxygen.</li>
<li>The full API for the code.</li>
<li>Output is html files</li>
<li>Doxygen automatically generates the help project file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of the documentation is written in the source code files. Doxygen scans these source code files and generates a full code API from them. It also generates UML style class diagrams and call diagrams. Beyond the code API, the developer documentation also includes anything the developers need to know for enhancing the code and adding to the OpenSEA project (specifically adding to source code). For example, this whole section on how to create project documentation is in the Developer Documentation.</p>
<p>Any documentation not included as part os the source code is added under a separate file structure. Doxygen can scan through multiple folders to create a single document which includes API and supplemental documentation. Organize the file structure similar to the final documentation structure. Sub-pages go within a sub-folder. Each documentation page is a separate text file, with a .dox file extension. All files are plain text ASII files.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Each documentation page is a separate text file, with a .dox file extension. All files are plain text ASII files. File formatting is Markdown</dd></dl>
<p>Files are formatted using Markdown formating. This is specifically the version of Markdown supported by Doxygen. <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html">Doxygen Markdown Support</a> Doxygen also supports <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/formulas.html">mathematical formulas</a>, using Latex. However, there should be very limited formulas included in the developer documentation.</p>
<p>Output from Doxygen should be html output, with the Qt .qhp file included. Write the Doxygen output to a completely separate folder from the original files. Keep the originals separated from the final output. This makes it easier to quickly revise the documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="documentation_theory"></a>
Theory Manual</h2>
<p>The theory manual explains the math and science behind the OpenSEA project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generated using Open Office / Libre Office</li>
<li>The equations behind the program</li>
<li>More styled like a scientific paper</li>
<li>Output is html files, generated from Libre Office / Open Office</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not reproduce an entire education on naval architecture and seakeeping theory. But within the science of seakeeping, there are many approaches and methods. The theory documentation should explicitely detail out the following things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exactly what the equations were</li>
<li>Exactly what methods were used</li>
<li>Exactly what assumptions were made</li>
<li>Exactly what simplifications were made</li>
</ol>
<p>Place the theory documentation in its own separate folder. Each documentation page should be a separate file. Organize the file structure similar to the final documentation structure. Sub-pages go within a sub-folder. The final Qt project file will specify the exact organization, so the file structure does not need to be 100% perfect.</p>
<p>Files are formatted using Open Office / Libre Office. A file template is provided. This template must be used. It is absolutely critical that the styles are used within this template. <b>Do not create your own styles or directly format anything.</b> This is because the final documentation replaces the formatting in the documentation with a reference to an external cascading style sheet (CSS) formatting. But the style names must remain the same. Otherwise the styles referenced in the documentation page do not match the formatting instructions in the CSS sheet.</p>
<p>Save the original files as .odt files. And then use SaveAs to publish the files as html files. Write the html files to a completely separate folder from the original files. Keep the originals separated from the final output. This makes it easier to quickly revise the documentation. The final .html files do not need to maintain the same folder structure as the originals. The Qt Project file handles that.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="documentation_user"></a>
User Manual</h2>
<p>The user manual handles the nuts and bolts of how to actually operate the program. What command to enter for each step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generated using Open Office / Libre Office</li>
<li>The instructions for operating the programs</li>
<li>Styled like a classic help file. Practical and simple</li>
<li>Output is html files, generated from Libre Office / Open Office</li>
</ul>
<p>The user documentation covers all the operational instructions. This is where you explain the general process of how to operate the program. Explain the concepts and how the data is organized. Get down to the practical details. Even simple things like: what units are the inputs given in? Also include general concepts. Example: explain what a body is within the program. Also include any tutorials and worked examples in this user documentation.</p>
<p>Place the user documentation in its own separate folder. Each documentation page should be a separate file. Organize the file structure similar to the final documentation structure. Sub-pages go within a sub-folder. The final Qt project file will specify the exact organization, so the file structure does not need to be 100% perfect.</p>
<p>Files are formatted using Open Office / Libre Office. A file template is provided. This template must be used. It is absolutely critical that the styles are used within this template. <b>Do not create your own styles or directly format anything.</b> This is because the final documentation replaces the formatting in the documentation with a reference to an external cascading style sheet (CSS) formatting. But the style names must remain the same. Otherwise the styles referenced in the documentation page do not match the formatting instructions in the CSS sheet.</p>
<p>Save the original files as .odt files. And then use SaveAs to publish the files as html files. Write the html files to a completely separate folder from the original files. Keep the originals separated from the final output. This makes it easier to quickly revise the documentation. The final .html files do not need to maintain the same folder structure as the originals. The Qt Project file handles that.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="documentation_common"></a>
Common Documentation</h2>
<p>Finally, there is some documentation that is common to every manual. This is included in its own separate folder and referenced by all three manauls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generated using Open Office / Libre Office</li>
<li>Really basic, common information</li>
<li>Styled like a dictionary or other reference material.</li>
<li>Output is html files, generated from Libre Office / Open Office</li>
</ul>
<p>The common documentation should be items like definitions for terms used in the program. Or common units of measurement for inputs and outputs. Really basic stuff.</p>
<h1>Document Numbering System</h1>
<p>Every document in the document numbering system must have a unique identifier number associated with it. The subpage explains the document numbering system. All developers must respect it. (Or come up with a better system and help me implement it.)</p>
<p><a class="el" href="docnumbersys.html">Documenation Numbering System</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="documentation_combine"></a>
Combining For Final Output</h1>
<p>You noticed that all manuals produce html output. This is the neutral medium that all the authoring tools publish to. We then use the Qt Help Project system to combine the html files into a single cohesive documentation file. Go through the following steps to publish the documentation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">For each manual, create The _Q_t _C_ompressed _H_elp file (.qch) from the html files.</p>
<p class="startli">a. First create the help project configuration file (.qhp).</p>
<p class="startli">b. Then execute the following command (linux operating system) to compile the compressed help file. doc.qhp is the name of the configuration file and output.qch is the name of the output Qt compressed help file. </p>
<pre class="fragment">qhelpgenerator doc.qhp -o output.qch
</pre></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Repeat this process for each manual. You should have three separate .qhp files when done.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Next create the final combined help collection file.</p>
<p class="startli">a. Create a collection configuration file (.qhcp)</p>
<p class="startli">b. Then execute the following command (linux operating system) to compile the final help collection file. mycollection.qhcp is the name of the configuration file and collection_output.qhc is the name of the final compiled collection file. </p>
<pre class="fragment">qcollectiongenerator mycollection.qhcp -o collection_output.qhc
</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>See the sub sections below for details on what to enter for each configuration file and how it all goes together. You can also look at this tutorial online, which gives a great overview for the process.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="documentation_using"></a>
Using the Documentation</h1>
<p>So you went through all that and created a Qt help file. But how to actually open it? We open is using the program Qt Assistant. And as part of the program, we specify a command option that indiciates which help file to open. </p>
<pre class="fragment">assistant -collectionfile mycollection.qhc
</pre><p>Where assistant is the linux command to start Qt Assistant. You can enter this into any terminal command line. And mycollection is the name of the compiled help collection file. This file should include all three manuals.</p>
<p>The Qt Assistant also has an API to call help pages from within the program you write. You can learn more at the subpages.</p>
