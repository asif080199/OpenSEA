\section*{Command Line Execution}

o\-Freq is executed through the following command \begin{DoxyVerb}:~> ofreq <Path to Directory>
\end{DoxyVerb}


The path is to the root directory of the o\-Freq analysis. For more information about the directory structure, see the page on \hyperlink{directory_structure}{Directory Structure}

\section*{Command Line Options}

Currently, o\-Freq has no command line options. It expects a path to the root directory of the o\-Freq analysis. If no path is specified, o\-Freq assumes it is the current working directory.

\section*{File Path}

File path can be specified just like any other file path. It can be a relative or absolute path.
