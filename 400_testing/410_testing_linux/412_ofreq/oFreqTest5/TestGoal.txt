This test performs a simple check of oFreqs ability to use hydrodynamic forces.  
It is set to only incorporate oFreqs ability to interpolate frequencies.  
It does not check the wave scaling features of the code.

A hydrodynamic database was created with simple values.  This makes it easy to
recognize patterns in the code.
