This test performs a simple check of oFreqs ability to use hydrodynamic forces.  
It is set to only incorporate oFreqs ability to interpolate frequencies.  
Wave scaling is included in this test.

A hydrodynamic database was created with simple values.  This makes it easy to
recognize patterns in the code.
