Please use the following object paradigm when naming any new methods in oFreq.

1.)  Methods are described as action, followed by subject, all as one word. Example:
     getObject
2.)  The action verb is not capitalized.  The subject is capitalized.  If the subject is made of multiple words, 
     write it all as one word, capitalizing each word.
   
3.)  Use the following conventions for verbs on objects:
     get:	Retrieve something from the object.  Retrieved variable passed by value.
     ref:	Retrieve something from the object.  Retrieved variable passed by reference.
     set:	Change some information into the object.  Inserted variable passed by value.
     add:	Insert some new information into the object.  Usually associated with a vector.
     list:	Access a vector from the object.
     list(index):	Access a specific item in the vector from the object.
