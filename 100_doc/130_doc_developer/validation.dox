Valication is an important part of the development for software engineering.  This is a formalized 
method of quality control checks to ensure the program works correctly.  The formalized method is a 
two step process:

-# Verification
-# Validation


## Verification

Verification is quality control on the equations as implemented within the program.  This focuses 
on two main elements.  First, confirming that the equations were actually coded into the program as 
they should be.  A typo can make a large difference for equations.

The second process is to ensure algebraic implementations match the original equations.  In 
engineering software, many of the equations involve differential equations and calculus.  However, 
computers do not have any native understanding of calculus.  So, we represent the differential 
equations as a series of algebraic equations, using a branch of science called [finite difference 
mathematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).

The algebraic representations are sometimes very complicated.  Verification involves checking each 
algebraic equation and working backwards to ensure it matches the original differential equation.  
This is largely a theoretical exercise and not covered in the Developer's Manual.  You will find 
the full details of verification in the Theory Manual.


## Validation

Validation essentially checks for bugs in the software, specifically focused on the equations.  
This is typically done by comparing the software to a series of test cases and comparing results.  
The following test cases were used for development of ofreq.  They start as simple cases to 
validate basic functionality, and move to progressively more complex cases that systematically test 
all of ofreq's features.


### Single Body Tests

These test focus only on single body performance for ofreq.

### Multiple Body Tests

These tests repeat all the features tested in the simple version.  But now they focus on 
multiple-bodies present in the analysis.

### Other Tests

Tests that do not fit nicely into any of the other categories, but they are still just as important.
