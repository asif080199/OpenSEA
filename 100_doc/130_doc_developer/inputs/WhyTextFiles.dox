# Why Text File Interface?

A major criticism of ofreq is that is does not natively use a GUI interface.  The subject of text file interaces was given careful consideration.  
There are several reasons why text file interfaces were used.  THe first and primary reason is:

- Provide a neutral interface between people with software engineering specialization and people with marine engineering specialization.

Many sections of ofreq require detailed knowledge of marine engineering and seakeeping mathematics.  This is knowledge that most software engineers
do not normally posses.  On the other hand, most marine engineers are not competent enough with programming to handle coding a GUI interface.  But
the marine engineer can normally handle a text file interface.  The text file interfaces provide a neutral format that is easily handled by
people in both skill sets:  marine engineering and software engineering.

The intent is always to provide a GUI for ofreq.  However, this GUI will stand on its own and support the entire OpenSEA software suite.

There are several other reasons for the text file interface.

1. Some advanced users (whole companies) may want to incorporate ofreq into their own calculation software.  In that case, the user will create their
own interace.  A text based interface allows users to develop third-party GUI's without re-coding and recompiling ofreq.
2. Many times users need to extract individual pieces of information from the outputs.  The text file interface makes it very easy to extract information
and paste into spreadsheet applications.
3. Users may log into remote computers to use this software.  Advanced engineering software, such as OpenSEA, is often installed on power machines
devoted exclusively for intense computations.  Sometimes these remote connections lack a GUI interface.  In that case, oFreq can still be used through
console only.
4. Eventually, OpenSEA will include a batch program that creates batch runs of these programs and edits the text files for both input and output.  
A text interface leaves open the most options for that batch program.

For all of these reasons, the text interface is the way I decided to go.  It only makes sense because I intend to eventualy supplement this with a GUI 
interface.
