 *May 15 2013       Shane Honanie       Initially created
 *Aug 13, 2013      Nicholas Barczak    Updated to reflect new motion model and motion solver paradigm.  Supplied more
 *                                      information to outputsBody object.  And separated each derived output as a

/**
 * This class holds all types of derived outputs for a single body object.  Each derived output type is contained
 * in a vector.  This allows multiple instances of each output type.  To save on memory, an output type is not
 * calculated until it is requested.  And then the derived output immediately returns the calculations.  Outputs are
 * typically returned as a vector of objects.  Each row in the vector represents a different wave frequency.  The object
 * contained in the returned vector The meaning may change with each derived output type.
 * You should check the documentation for each derived output.
 *
 * Each derived output is listed as its own item in the class.  Each derived output class has the following methods
 * associated with it.  (For this generic example, the term Output refers to any derived output object.)
 * 1.  refOutput:  Pointer to the output object itself.
 * 2.  getOutput:  Calculates the output and writes the result out as a cx_matrix object.
 * 3.  addOutput:  Adds a new output object to the list of objects.  Optionally takes the supplied output.  Otherwise
 *                 creates a new output object in the vector list.
 *
 * To use the outputsBody class, you must supply several properties to it.  These properties give the outputs class
 * full knowledge of the current state of affairs.  This allows the different derived outputs to have the most
 * flexibility for how to calculate results.  Set the following properties:
 *
 * Data Sets:
 * 1.  Bodies list
 * 2.  Solutions list
 * 3.  Frequencies list
 * 4.  Wave directions list
 *
 * Individual properties
 * 1.  Current body for outputsBody object.
 * 2.  Current wave direction.
 *
 * Once these properties are set, you may calculate derived outputs.  Inputs for derived outputs may be set
 * before all these properties are set.
 *
 * The following derived outputs are available:
 * @sa GlobalSolution
 * @sa GlobalMotion
 * @sa GlobalVelocity
 * @sa GlobalAcceleration
 *
 * Developers note:  The original scheme had the OutputDerived class include a pointer to the contain parent class,
 * OutputsBody.  But this creates a cyclic dependency of header files, and will not compile.  The only resolution I
 * found to this was to not include the parent class and pass all the necessary information to each individual
 * OutputDerived object.  This is tedious, but within the reasons of the methods defined by the OutputsBody class.
 * And it allow compilation.  All data items are passed by reference to avoid excess memory duplication.
