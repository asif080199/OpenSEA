/**
 * @brief The SeaModel_DuealDirection class creates the model for a full sea environment, two directions.
 *
 * This SeaModel implements a dual direction wave distribution.  It assumes two primary wave directions, with
 * further waves distributed around those primary directions.
 * The SeaModel produces two primary results:
 * 1.  Wave energy at a specified wave direction and wave frequency.
 * 2.  Wave amplitude at a specified wave direction and wave frequency.
 *
 * This implementation requires you to only define a two wave spetra and associated wave direction.  The
 * SeaModel then scales it automatically, based on relation to the defined wave direction.  You can also define
 * a wave scaling parameter for the wave spectrum.  This may be necessary if you want to scale the results somehow.
 *
 * The wave spectra, wave directions, and wave scaling are stored in the lists just like in the base sea model.
 * However, their place in the list represents the significance of each wave spectra.
 * Index 1:  The primary wave spectra and direction.
 * Index 2:  The secondary wave spectra and direction.
 *
 * The SeaModel does have one important limitation:  You must supply it a full list of wave frequencies before
 * requesting wave amplitude.  This is because the calculations for wave amplitude depend on the spacing of the
 * wave frequencies, and those frequencies may not be regularly spaced.  Individual WaveSpec objects have their own
 * frequency data sets.  And the SeaModel has no way to correlate between those frequency lists.  That is why the
 * SeaModel must have its own governing set of wave frequencies.  When you specify a wave frequency and direction
 * to get wave amplitude, you can only select from one of the governing frequencies defined in the list.  This is
 * necessary to ensure the programming is mathematically correct.
 *
 * The list of wave frequencies does not need to be sorted.  The SeaModel will automatically sort after the list
 * gets defined.  Same for the wave directions.
