 *
 * This is where each EquationofMotion object is created.  Can
 * also be any object from a class that is derived from the EquationofMotion object.  Before adding equations
 * within this motion model, the individual equation must be defined.  These will be new objects inheritted from
 * the EquationofMotion object. Once those new equation clases are defined, they can be used in the motion model.
 *
 * Using an EquationofMotion in the motion model will generally follow the following sequence.  All step are
 * executed within the DefineEquations function.
 * 1.)  Create a new object from the appropriate class which is derived from the EquationofMotion.  When creating
 *      the equation of motion, you must include the pointer to the existing motion model.  Use the keyword this
 *      when creating the new object.
 * 2.)  Set the data index for the equation.  This is probably the most important step.
 *      Regardless of what name you give the equation, the program ofreq only sees the equation as one in a list
 *      of equations, and refers to it by its index within that list.  Any input data (such as hydrodynamic
 *      or user coefficients) is similarly referenced by that index.  When you set the data index, you tell
 *      ofreq which index in the list of data is has available should correspond to this specific equation.
 *      (Set the data index using the function setDataIndex().
 * 3.)  Set the name for the new object.  This is just the short name or equation symbol. (Use the function
 *      setName() to set it.)
 * 4.)  Set the description for the new object.  This is the more extensive name for the equation.  (Use the
 *      function setDescription() to set it.)
 * 5.)  Now that you set all the appropriate information, add the equation of motion into the list of equations
 *      used by this motion model.  (Use the function AddEquation()).
 *
 * Once you define all the equations, you will also want to define a name for your motion model.  This is the
 * name you will use to select the motion model within the input files.  It can be any sequence you want and
 * include spaces.  One name is already reserved as part of the standard program models.  You can not use
 * the following name:
 * "6DOF" - Reserved.*
