/**
 * @brief The EqnTranslation class.
 *
 * This class defines motion for linear translation in one of the three
 * principle axes.  (X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis).  This is specific to rigid body motion and intended for applicaiton
 * in a six-degree of freedom (6DOF) motion model.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This class is a derived equation of motion.  It inherits all the programming
 * needed to define an equation of motion from the class EquationofMotion.
 *
 * Custom equation classes serve a specific purpose.  All the programming necessary to define an equation of motion
 * within the program ofreq is already contained within the class EquationofMotion.  All that programming gets
 * inherited from the class.  The only thing the custom class needs to define is the specific equation for this
 * purpose.  That equation is contained inside the function setFormula().  Everything else is already defined, as
 * far as programming.
 *
 * There are specific requirements for how to define the custom EquationofMotion class.  These instructions assume
 * the user has some basic experience with C++ programming.  If not, first try a few tutorials.  There are numerous
 * tutorials on the internet.  You should specifically familiarize yourself with concepts such as namespaces,
 * classes, objects, and functions.  Every effort was made to isolate the user from the complexity of the ofreq
 * program, but some basic understand of program operation is needed.
 *
 * Assuming you have a basic knowledge of C++ programming, you can create your custom equation of motion by editing
 * the .cpp file associated with this class.  Follow these basic rules:
 *
 * 1.)  Always create a backup of every file before you edit it.
 *
 * 2.)  Only edit the .cpp file.  Leave the header file alone (the .h file).  The header file creates the linking
 *      necessary to make everything work correctly.
 *
 * 3.)  Only define your equation within the function setFormula().
 *
 * 4.)  Do not add function definitions to the header file unless you are familiar with C++ class programming and
 *      know how to safely add the function into the class definition.  If you need to define custom functions
 *      for your equstions, the safest thing is to define them strictly within your source code file (.cpp file).
 *      Just remember that all functions must be fully defined before they get used within the code.
 *
 * 5.)  There are several functions inheritted from the EquationofMotion class.  You can use these to refer to the
 *      different forces when developing your own equation of motion.  oFreq recognizes seven (7) basic force types
 *      shown below, with the function name to reference them in the EquationofMotion. (Arguments for each function
 *      are not shown, for sake of clarity.
 *      5.1) ForceMass() = The forces associated with the mass of an object.  This includes direct mass for
 *           straight linear motion, and moment of inertia for rotational motion.
 *      5.2) ForceActive_hydro() = The forces which are independant of body motions.  The hydro subcategory
 *           refers to active forces that specifically come from hydrodynamic forces.  This includes the forces
 *           from incident waves.  Sometimes call the Froude-Krylov forces.
 *      5.3) ForceActive_user() = The forces which are independant of body motions.  The user subcategory
 *           refers to active forces specifically defined by the user in the ofreq run file.  These may be
 *           some external force such as an active control system.  Regardless, it is customed defined by the user.
 *      5.4) ForceReact_hydro() = The forces which are reactive and dependant on body motions.  This includes
 *           derivatives of body motions.  The hydro subcategory refers to reactive forces hydrodynamic in
 *           origin.  This would include body hydrostatic properties, added damping, and added mass.
 *      5.5) ForceReact_user() = The forces which are reactive and dependant on body motions.  This includes
 *           derivatives of body motions.  The user subcategory refers to reactive forces defined by the user.
 *           This might include external forces such as a mooring line or dynamic positioning system.  In any
 *           case, these are reactive forces defined at run time in the ofreq input files.
 *      5.6) ForceCross_hydro() = The forces which are reactive and dependant on the body motions of another
 *           body.  This is only applicable to multi-body systems.  Examples might be two vessels near each other.
 *           The program can accept equations that use the cross-body forces but are only applied to a single
 *           body problem.  The hydro subcategory refers to reactive forces hydrodynamic in
 *           origin.  This would include body hydrostatic properties, added damping, and added mass, except that
 *           these forces would be dependant on the motions of another body.
 *      5.7) ForceCross_user() = The forces which are reactive and dependant on the body motions of another
 *           body.  This is only applicable to multi-body systems.  Examples might be two vessels near each other.
 *           The program can accept equations that use the cross-body forces but are only applied to a single
 *           body problem.  The user subcategory refers to reactive forces defined by the user.
 *           This might include external forces such as a mooring line or dynamic positioning system.  In any
 *           case, these are reactive forces defined at run time in the ofreq input files.
 *
 * 6.)  Use of the Sum() Function.  The Sum function expects a function pointer to be supplied as the equation it
 *      will sum over.  The function pointer is necessary due to limitations of the C++ programming language.
 *      Any functions supplied to the sum function can not have any arguments supplied.  To use a function in
 *      the Sum function, follow these steps:
 *      6.1) Define the function as normal.  Remember that the function must have a full code supplied before
 *           its first use.  The safest approach is to define this function wholly within the source code file
 *           (the .cpp file).  That keeps the function isolated from the rest of the oFreq program.
 *           The function data type must be complex, double.  So a typical function definition would look like
 *           the following.  (Capitals are the parts you change for your specific function).
 *
 *           std::complex<double> FUNCTION_NAME() {
 *              *FUNCTION CODE*
 *              return FUNCTION_VALUE;
 *           }
 *
 *      6.2) Once you have defined the function, you must use it in the Sum function.  The Sum function expects
 *           a pointer to a function.  You would enter it as follows (all capitals are the terms you change for
 *           your specific function:
 *
 *           output = Sum( &FUNCTION_NAME, index, from, to);
 *
 *           Two key points to notice:  The function name was preceded with a reference symbol ( & ); and I only
 *           stated the function name.  I did not include the brackets to explicitely state that its a function.
 *           Don't include the brackets.  You will get a compiler error if you do.
 *
 *      6.3) If you have advanced C++ programming experience, you can use lambda functions to define and implement
 *           your function pointer in line.  This requires a basic understand of lambda functions, but it does
 *           produce more streamlined code which better shows the intended functionality.  Note that C++11 is
 *           required for lambda functions.  This is already implemented in the Qt project supplied with the
 *           source code.  For a quick tutorial on how to use lambda functions, visit:
 *           <http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-lambda-closures.html>
 *           For an example, a typical lambda implementation in this program would look like this:
 *
 *           [&] () -> complex<double> {return ForceReact_hydro(ord(),var()) * Ddt(var(),ord());}
 *
 *           The square brackets denote the lambda function.  The () marks show that the function has no inputs.
 *           The -> specifies the returned variable type.  Everything in the curly brakets is the actual function
 *           definition.  This lambda function would be implemented in the Sum() function in the following manner
 *           Sum(
 *                  [&] () -> std::complex<double> {return ForceReact_hydro(ord(),var()) * Ddt(var(),ord());},
 *                  "ord",
 *                  0,
 *                  2
 *           );
