 * repetitions of the same sequence, just with a different equation index.  In that case, multiple instances of the

     * @param force Input to specify which items the results should Sum across.  Typically, this is one of the built-in
     * force functions. However, it can be any function, any item, any calculation.  The only catch is that the
     * input value must be a std::complex<double> data type.  Input format is a function pointer.  This allows
     * the Sum function to update as it performs iterations.  The only catch is that you can not combine multiple
     * values into one.  You must define a single function for each input argument you want.
     * @param index std::string specifying which variable should be summed on.  This may be any one of these options:
     * Order of derivative = "ord"
     * Variable = "var"
     * Body = "bod"
     * @param from Integer for the beginning value of the summation.  Default value of negative one (-1) indicates that
     * the summation will happen at the lowest value of the variable index specified.
     * @param to Integer for the ending value of the summation.  Default value of negative one (-1) indicates that
     * the summation will happen at the highest value of the variable index specified.
     * @return Returns a complex value that is the summation of the index and limits specified.
